      "summary": "Research focus: Collective action in machine learning and development of generative model frameworks. Studied how a change of optimization and learning algorithm affects the success of collective action. Investigated the connection between density estimation to a simpler training algorithm for WGANs. Supervised by Samira Samadi (MPI-IS) and Amartya Sanyal (University of Copenhagen). Previous work in the Perceiving Systems department, developing a 3D articulated model of laboratory rats with Michael J. Black (MPI-IS), Silvia Zuffi (IMATI-CNR) and Sergi Pujades (INRIA) using computer vision tools."

In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
