# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a pi/cture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a PhD candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, focusing on collective action in ML and novel generative modeling frameworks.
My research explores how individuals can coordinate data modifications to influence machine learning outcomes, alongside the creation of new generative modeling frameworks.
I am passionate about the interaction of machine learning with the real world, from what we can learn about the world using ML, to how society and ML can influence each other.
